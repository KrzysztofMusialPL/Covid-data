# Covid-data
A study based on the Kaggle data set, aimed at determining the dependence of COVID-19 mortality on various factors and determining the TOP 3 comorbidities for high mortality of COVID-19 patients.

Data source - Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meirnizri/covid19-dataset). 

The dataset was provided by the Mexican government (https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/informacion-referente-a-casos-covid-19-en-mexico). This dataset contains an enormous number of anonymized patient-related information including pre-conditions. The raw dataset consists of 21 unique features and 1,048,576 unique patients.
